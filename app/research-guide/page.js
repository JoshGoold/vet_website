          We invite individuals from all backgroundsâ€”educators, history enthusiasts, military personnel, family members of service members, social justice advocates, and members of the general public to use this guide to conduct historical research to help write the life stories of Canadian aircrew members who served during World War II and have no known grave. Together, we can honour their service and preserve their memory.
